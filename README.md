# CORE PARTS OF EXPRESS
========================
# MIDDLEWARE
The idea is pretty simple: rather than one monolithic request handler 
function, you call several request handler functions that each deal 
with a small chunk of the work.

# ROUTING
Like middleware, it breaks the one monolithic request handler function 
into smaller pieces. Unlike middleware, these request handlers are 
executed conditionally, depending on what URL and HTTP method a client 
sends.

# SUBAPPLICATIONS
Express applications can often be pretty small, even fitting in just one
file. As your applications get larger, though, youâ€™ll want to break them up
into multiple folders and files.
ex. routers
compartmentalize your app into smaller pieces.

# Mongoose
=============== 
is a MongoDB object modeling tool that provides a schema-based solution to model application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks. Using Mongoose with this backend stack provides a higher layer over MongoDB with more functionality, including mapping object
models to database documents.


# express.Router() 
is used to define route paths with the relevant HTTP methods and
assign the corresponding controller function that should be called when these
requests are received by the server.
ex. router.get('/sikwet', sikwet)
